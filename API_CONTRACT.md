## Authentication & Authorization

*   This contract does not explicitly define authentication/authorization mechanisms. For a production API, you would need to implement a strategy (e.g., JWT Bearer tokens, API keys for service-to-service communication if applicable). Endpoints might require authentication to ensure only authorized users can create/modify data.

## Notes on AI Summary
*   The `POST /games` endpoint currently expects the `aiSummary` to be provided by the client, as per your current application flow where the client calls the Gemini API.
*   If the backend were to take responsibility for generating the AI summary, the `aiSummary` field would be removed from the `POST /games` request body, and the server would generate it (asynchronously or synchronously) before storing the game. This would require the backend to have access to the Gemini API key.
